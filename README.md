# BShop

## Project description
BShop is an eCommerce Web Application which was entirely developed by me using ReactJS. It's not an usual eCommerce site where only the administrator of the page uploads products and manages the content. On BShop, every non-restricted user can upload his own products, either used or brand new. For authenticaton, database and storage I used Firebase v9. 
#### However, why so?
The main advantage is that you can buy products directly from another person with a fixed price and no commission is taken by the site. The major flaw of this method of building an eCommerce site is the freedom that every user has on uploading their products and possible scams, but these situations can be avoided because the admin can restrict certain users from posting, and the user rating system helps other users to be informed by seller's past.
#### What does the name stand for?
The letter B is the abbreviation of my first name (Bogdan) and the word "Shop". When read loud, it sounds like "bishop" which explains the logo's appearance.
## Features
This site has very useful features, including:
- Sign up/in/out
- User profile
- Product filter (by name and category)
- User Rating
- Form to add your own product
- Inbox 
- Profile editing

## Visitor's Guide 
### How do I upload my own product?
You can upload your own product by clicking on the "Add your product" item listed in the navigation bar. This action requires you to be logged in to an existing account. You will be redirected to a form page where you can give details about the product you want to publish and add up to 8 images to it. When uploading a product make sure you are very specific with the details you give. Make sure to be respectful when uploading a product, any troll product/user profile will result in a temporary/permanent restriction. 
### How do I sign in or up?
You can click "Your account" from the navigation bar. If you are logged, you will be redirected to your profile, but if you are not logged in you wlll be redirected to the login page. If you don't have an account, use the "Don't have an account?" button at the bottom of the form and you will be redirecteed to the register page
